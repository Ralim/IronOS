### CJK Notes

Unlike Latin and Cyrillic scripts, CJK Unified Ideographs cannot be legibly
displayed using the small font, which is only 6x8px in size. Therefore, Hanzi,
Kanji and Hanja can only be displayed using the 12x16px large font.

When translating menu names, settings names and warning messages, they must
use the single-line format which causes them to be printed using the large
font.

Other texts which use the small font must remain in English.

Due to the nature of the current font handling, the same applies to Kana and
Hangul. If you are a Japanese or Korean user and would like to see Kana or
Hangul displayed using the small font, please open an issue.
