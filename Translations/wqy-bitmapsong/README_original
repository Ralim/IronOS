 I. Introduction

WenQuanYi bitmap fonts include all 20,932 Unicode 5.2 
CJK Unified Ideographs (U4E00 - U9FA5) and 6,582 
CJK Extension A characters (U3400 - U4DB5) at 
5 different pixel sizes (9pt-12X12, 10pt-13X13, 
10.5pt-14x14, 11pt-15X15 and 12pt-16x16 pixel).
Use of this bitmap font for on-screen display of Chinese 
(traditional and simplified) in web pages and elsewhere 
eliminates the annoying "blurring" problems caused by 
insufficient "hinting" of anti-aliased vector CJK fonts. 
In addition, Latin characters, Japanese Kanas and 
Korean Hangul glyphs (U+AC00~U+D7A3) are also included.

This font was built upon the previous works by firefly
(firefly[at]firefly(dot)idv(dot)tw)[2]. The 12pt bitmap
glyphs between U3400-U9FA5 were derived from Chinese 
national standard GB19966-2005 [3].

We release this font to the public as an open-source 
software in terms of GNU General Public License version 2. 
You are free to copy, distribute, and/or modify this 
font as long as you pass the freedoms to the users
of the derived work.

We hope you find this font useful. Please direct your 
feedback and bug-reports to our forum at

  http://wenq.org/forum/

In addition to bitmap font development, we also develop
vector fonts and other CJK-related resources at WenQuanYi.

We also welcome donations if you found this font to be 
useful to you.

 III. About The WenQuanYi Project

The Wen Quan Yi Project was founded by Qianqian Fang[5] in 
Oct. 2004. The goal of this project is to develop CJK 
related open-source software and resources. The initial 
effots of the project focused on creating high quality 
bitmap character glyphs and outline fonts for all 
70,000+ CJK characters currently encoded by the 
Unicode Consortium [4]. 

The contributors of the Wen Quan Yi Project use wiki[1] 
as the primary development tool for glyph creation, documentation
and coordinations. The Wen Quan Yi wiki (Habitat wiki: 
http://wenq.org/habitat/ ) was developed by Qianqian Fang
based on UseModWiki v1.0.

For commercial use, please contact the project
maintainer (Qianqian Fang) or consult copyright law firms to
make sure your plan is compliant with the font licenses.
Commercial licenses are also available upon request.
