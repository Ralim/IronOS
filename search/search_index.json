This menu is meant to be simple, so it has no fancy GUI animations. Access it by pressing the rear button ( -/B ) on the iron while it is on the home screen. Use the front button ( +/A ) to scroll through the menu. To exit, use the rear button ( -/B ) again. Menu items Items are shown in the menu on a single line, so they use short codes and appear in this order: ID This is used by Irons that have an ID and serial number to help check if the iron is authentic. All Pinecil V1 show the same ID number as this is the number programmed into the MCU. The new Pinecil V2 released Aug. 2, 2022 now uses MCU BL706, which enables generating a unique ID/Serial number to every iron. This can be used to verify your Pinecil authenticity here . ACC This indicates the accelerometer that is fitted inside the unit. MMA8652 LIS2DH12 BMA223 MSA301 SC7A20 None -> running in fallback without movement detection Scanning -> Still searching I2C for one PWR This indicates the current power source for the iron. This may change during power up as the sources are negotiated in turn. DC input (dumb) QC input (We used QC2/3 negotiation for current supply) PD W. VBus input (PD subsystem is used to negotiate for current supply); and VBus is connected to your input power source PD No VBus input (PD subsystem is used to negotiate for current supply); and VBus is NOT connected to your input power source. If it is Not required or possible to do a special mod of your PCB (i.e. late model V1, some early Green PCB models) then [PD No VBus] displays on-screen ( see details and PD Debug section below ). Vin The input voltage as read by the internal ADC. Can be used to sanity check it is being read correctly. Tip C This is the tip temperature in \u00b0C. This can be used with RTip for assessing temperature processing performance. Han C This is the handle temperature or more accurately the reading of the Cold Junction Compensation (CJC) temperature sensor. This is expressed in \u00b0C. Range of 20-40 \u00b0C is normal depending on how hot/cold the room is and how long power has been plugged in which warms the PCB further. This is used for CJC of the tip temperature. If CHan is extremely high, this indicates the temperature sensor isn't reading correctly ( see Troubleshooting ) Max C This indicates the max temperature in \u00b0C that the system estimates it can measure the tip reliably to. This is dependent on a few factors including the handle temperature so it can move around during use. As you use the iron, the Max increases to a point. UpTime This shows how many deciseconds the unit has been powered for (600 ds = 1 minute). Move This is the last timestamp of movement. When the iron is moved, this should update to match the Time field (previous menu item). This can be used for checking performance of the movement detection code. Tip Res This indicates the tip resistance that the device is currently using. For devices with multiple possible values to choose from (Pinecil V2), the appropriate value is automatically detected at every boot-up. Tip should be installed before boot-up or reading can not be done. Tip R This is the raw tip reading in \u03bcV. Tip must be installed or reading will be high/inaccurate. At cool, the range of 700-1000 is normal for larger tips and ~1500 for smaller tips (TS80). This is used to evaluate the calibration routines. Tip O This is the offset resulting from the 'Cold Junction Compensation Calibration' . HW G This indicates the high water mark for the stack for the GUI thread. The smaller this number is, the less headroom we have in the stack. As this is a high-water mater, you should only trust this once you have walked through all GUI options to \"hit\" the worst one. HW M This indicates the high-water mark for the stack for the movement detection thread. The smaller this number is, the less headroom we have in the stack. HW P This indicates the high-water mark for the stack for the PID thread. The smaller this number is, the less headroom we have in the stack. Hall This appears if your device is capable of having a hall effect sensor installed (Pinecil). This shows the current magnetic field strength reading from the sensor. It is used to check if the sensor is operational, and for diagnostics and optimal placement of magnets on a stand (higher number is better/stronger). See Hall Sensor for details . PD Debug menu On the Pinecil; if the iron is booted up while long holding the front button ( + ); it will show an extra hidden menu for inspecting USB-PD power adapters. We can also connect to any PD USB power to check Vbus status, even some cell phones with a USB-C port will work if it is PD. It will not show PD messages when Pinecil is powered by DC port, QC, or USB 5V (non-PD). For example, if you connect to a QC charger, you may simply see \"PD State 6\" which indicates \"waiting for source\" as no PD messages will be ever be sent and you will not be able to use ( + ) to scroll through PD negotiated messages. Pressing ( + ) cycles through elements, and ( - ) or unplugging will exit the menu. The first page shows the PD negotiation stage number; which can be used for diagnosing if PD is not working. Once negotiation is complete; use ( + ) button to advance to other screens which show the different proposals advertised for voltage and current (State 12 means all is good with the PD charger). Below is a method for user modification to convert some early models of Pinecil V1 to safely support 24V on the DC5525 barrel. \u26a0\ufe0f Warning: do this at your own risk, read everything in this document, and go to the Pine64 community chat if you desire advice. An incorrect cut of the trace could render the Pinecil non-working. Background: a simple user modification to the PCB on some models of original V1 allows it to safely use DC barrel 24V by cutting a trace line to the Vbus which held it back to 21V. You can check whether your Pinecil V1 needs the update or can benefit from it by using a hidden trick in the PD debug menu. Follow instructions above to enter the PD Debug menu. After a few seconds or after PD negotiates (state above 5) it will show [PD No VBus] if it is not needed (i.e., late model V1). Alternately, if it shows [VBus] , then the mod has not been done and there is still a connection to the Vbus (the Vbus connection limits you to 21V until you do the mod). If you need to do the mod, then follow the instructions/links below which have photos. Careful to only cut the trace and nothing else. Then use the PD debug menu again to check for [PD No Vbus] before attaching any 24V PSU to the DC barrel. If you do not get the message, then try cutting the trace a little deeper or using alcohol to clear the gap of copper dust. Then check PD messages again. If you need advice/tips, join the Pine64 chat room. The mod method is shown in the February 2022 PINE64 community updates . Early Pinecil V1 models required cutting a trace to achieve 24V safety with DC barrel PSU. Late model V1 made sometime in 2022 came with [No Vbus] already displayed, and no mod is required. | Pinecil V2 model released Aug. 2, 2022 is an overhaul of the PCB with all relevant components capable of 28V.

STM32CubeIDE The easiest way to start working with the STM32CubeIDE is to create a new project for the STM32F103RCTx. Once this is created, remove the auto-generated source code. Next, drag the contents of the source folder into the project and choose to link to files. You will need to update the build settings for include paths and point to the new .ld linker file. Command line tools and building a release In the source folder there is a Makefile that can be used to build the repository using command line tools. When running the make command, specify which model of the device and the language(s) you would like to use. macOS Use the following steps to set up a build environment for IronOS on the command line (in Terminal). Follow steps 1 \u2013 3 here to install the toolchain needed to compile for STM32 microcontrollers.

If your device did not come with IronOS already installed, or if you need to update to the latest version; please see the flashing guide for your device: MHP30 Pinecil V1 Pinecil V2 TS80 / TS80P TS100 It is recommended to update to the newest stable release. Once your Iron has been flashed, on first power on it may warn you about the system settings being reset. Do not panic ; this is 100% completely normal. This is here to note to you that they have been reset to handle the internal structure changing. If you receive a warning about the accelerometer or USB-PD not being detected, please see here . The Home screen (or idle screen) This is the landing page of the firmware, from here you can choose to either go into the settings menu or go into soldering mode . By default this will show a screen similar to the one below: Note that this may be drawn mirrored depending on the orientation of your screen (detailed mode shows a different home screen). The soldering iron symbol on the screen will appear near the tip. This is here to indicate that pressing the button closest to the front of the iron will enter soldering mode. And naturally, the spanner like icon represents that pressing the button near the rear of the soldering iron will enter the settings menu. In the settings, you can turn on a detailed idle screen instead. The buttons still function the same, however, the image will be swapped for a text telling you the current status of the iron with extra details. Depending on how your device is being powered, at right side of the screen, the firmware will either show the voltage your unit is being provided with, a battery icon (if battery mode is enabled) or a power plug icon. If you see an ( X ) where the soldering iron should be, this indicates that the firmware can't see the tip connected. This could indicate a problem with the iron or tip. First, try removing the tip screw and tip and gently reinstalling both; ensure that the tip is seated all the way back. If the issue persists please see the hardware issues section . This OLED screen features burn-in protection; if no buttons or movement have been detected for a while it will automatically blank the screen to reduce burn-in when the iron is left unattended. Any movement or button press will wake the screen. Hidden Extras Additionally to the two icons shown, there are two \"hidden\" actions that can be performed on this menu. If you press and hold the button near the tip ( +/A ), this enters the temperature adjustment screen. Normally this is not required; but if you would like to adjust the set temperature before the tip starts to heat, this can be useful. If you press and hold the button near the rear of the iron ( -/B ), it will take you into the debug menu . Soldering Mode When you press the button to enter the soldering mode, the iron will instantly start to heat up the tip. The firmware defaults to 320 \u00b0C as the set point for the soldering mode, however on this screen you can enter into the adjustment screen by pressing either button. Pressing and holding the button near the tip will enter Boost mode. This allows a temporary override of the set temperature to a higher (or lower) value. This can be useful as a way to force the tip to a higher temperature to drive more wattage into a large joint when the thermal connection is not ideal. Pressing and holding the rear button will exit soldering mode and land you back at the home screen. You can also do this by pressing both buttons at once and this will also work, this is a bit harder to do but is kept for compatibility with the Miniware firmware. Pressing and holding both buttons at once will enter locked mode, which will prevent the buttons from doing anything. You can in the settings allow boost mode in locked mode optionally. This can be useful if you find yourself hitting the buttons and entering into the temperature adjustment screen by accident. Idle Sleep If the iron detects a period of time without any significant movement, it will enter sleep mode. This is indicated with a screen graphic similar to Zzzz (or text in detailed mode). In Sleep mode, the temperature of the iron automatically lowers to 150 \u00b0C (default), which is just below the melting point of the solder. This helps reduce rate of oxidation and damage to the iron tip. In general, when not using the iron, unplug it or let it sleep to increase the longevity of replaceable tips. The default sleep temperature can be customized. Simply picking up or moving the iron will wake it back up into soldering mode. You can also press any button and this will also wake the iron up. Optional Hall Effect Feature (Pinecil only): Pinecil has an unpopulated footprint (U14) for a hall effect sensor (Si7210-B-00-IV). Adding the sensor and placing a neodymium magnet on the holder stand will trigger Pinecil to sleep after it enters the stand, and Zzzz will appear on-screen. The magnet is positioned on the stand in proximity to the sensor/handle which then activates one of 10 user defined settings (0=off, 1=lowest sensitivity, 9=highest sensitivity). Read the Hall Sensor document for details on installation . Idle Shutdown If, after entering sleep mode, the iron still does not see movement for a much longer time (default=10 minutes); it will shut down and return to the home screen. Settings Menu The settings menu is the most evolving aspect of the firmware, so each option is not documented here. However, do not panic, as every menu option has an on-screen description so you don't need to come back here to figure them all out. To navigate the menu, the two buttons act separately. The rear button ( -/B ) is pressed to enter the menu and scrolls down the main options, and the other front button ( +/A ) will enter and change the current option. To see a description of an option, just wait, and after a few seconds, it will scroll across the screen. The menu is comprised of a 'main menu' of categories and then sub-items that allow you to adjust parameters. You can long hold buttons to change through options faster, and there is some acceleration when holding the buttons. There is a small scrollbar that appears along the right edge of the screen to indicate how far through the current list you are (looks like a dot). Additionally, this scrollbar will blink rapidly when you are on the last value in a range of a sub-menu. For example, if you are in Motion Sensitivity, which has a range of 0 - 9, it will blink when you are at 9. I highly recommend taking a few minutes to go through all of the options in the menu to get a feel for what you can change, almost every aspect of the internal system is adjustable to suit your needs. If you want to start over, simply go to Advanced settings > Restore default settings, confirm using the front ( +/A ) button.

This could be a fun enhancement for any Pinecil and adds a feature typically only found in more expensive high-end irons. The HES is available at many electronic stores for ~$2-$6.

A very strong/large magnet would be required on the stand to activate the sleep mode if you use setting 1. Setting of 9 would be useful if you only had a small magnet and are not concerned about Pinecil falsely triggering sleep mode near magnetized items/tools.

Please check the currently open and recently closed issues to check if anyone else has run into this. You can try going back to a release on the firmware to test if this is a new issue before opening an issue. If this is a new iron, also feel free to open an issue if you don't see any; a vendor could have changed the model of the accelerometer on us without warning again . In which case, support should come shortly. If your iron is new, there is a slim chance your accelerometer may be DOA and need replacement. Note this warning will only be shown the first few times until settings are reset No USB-PD IC detected Generally, this means either something went very awry in the firmware, or the chip is not answering as would normally be expected. Try rolling back to an earlier release to confirm if the issue still persists then the device may need repair. If you have some form of seller protection/support, you most likely want to reach out to this to be safe. If you don't, you can always attempt to replace the IC yourself. As of writing both the TS80P and Pinecil use the FUSB302.

The best way to see if this is the case is to measure the resistance across the contacts to the tip using a multimeter. you are expecting to see measurements in the range of 4-10 ohms. Anything higher than 10 ohms is generally an issue. Iron will not heat up and displays a high temperature Check the Rtip and CHan numbers ( see debug menu ). Extremly high CHan is suspect to a problem with the cold junction compensation temperature sensor. For Pinecil V1, inspect near U10 which is the TMP36 sensor ( see issue here ). You may be able to reflow/resolder the TMP36 chip at U10 to correct a weak solder joint. If it worked on older firmware, but not on 2.16+, weak solder joints are suspect. The newer firmware runs the ADC a bit faster to keep tighter control of the tip temperature. Normally this wont cause an issue as the output from the TMP36 is powerful enough to keep up without any issue. But if you have a weak or cold solder joint this could cause issues. If the CHan is extremely high, and reflowing the temperature sensor does not resolve the issue; inspect the pins in the main MCU, possibly try giving them a light squeeze to the board while watching CHan.

Generating the Logo files There are community logo's already converted and ready to use in IronOS-Meta/releases . Download the zip for Pinecil or Miniware and then install using the instructions in the Flashing section below. If you want to make custom art then it needs to be converted with a Python script. The script and other needed files are in IronOS-Meta . Go to that folder, then it is easiest to select the green Code button (upper right), then Download Zip. This way you get all the files you need and some extras. You only need what is inside Boot Logos. Put your custom image inside the Boot Logos folder with all python script files already there. The Python script converts an image passed into it on the command line into both a .hex file and a .dfu to be uploaded to the iron in DFU mode. The image can be in color and any size, but it will be resized and converted to 1-bit color. However, it looks best if you create a 96x16 image (Png or Bmp) in any image editor and color the pixels black & white manually. The converter requires at least Python3 and Pillow apps. Follow online instructions for installing Python and Pillow. For Windows, it is recommended to use Windows PowerShell instead of Command. Open Powershell (run as administrator), type python to install it, it will open microsoft store where you can install it free. Go back to Powershell and install Pillow. What works can vary, but this command may work: python -m pip install Pillow or python3 -m pip install pillow If the above does not work, see this page on StackOverflow about installing Pillow. Now that Python and Pillow are successfuly installed, you can convert an image.

This means a computer is not required to change any setting. Soldering mode In this mode the iron works as you would expect, pressing either button will take you to a temperature change screen. - Use each button to go up/down in temperature. Pressing both buttons exits the temperature menu (or wait 3 seconds and it will time out). - Pressing both buttons or holding the rear button ( -/B ) will exit Soldering Mode. - Holding the front button ( +/A ) will enter Boost mode (if enabled). Settings mode This mode allows you to cycle through all the options and set custom values. The menu is arranged so that the most often used settings are first. The rear button ( -/B ) cycles through the main options. The front button ( +/A ) changes the selected option. Note that settings are not saved until you exit the menu. If you idle on a setting (i.e., don't press any buttons), after 3 seconds, the screen scrolls a brief description (mini help guide). Enter submenus using the front button ( +/A ) if you are going to change it or wish to view it. Scrolling through the all options of a submenu will return you back to its entry location. Calibrating input voltage Due to the tolerance on the resistors used for the input voltage divider, some irons can be up to 0.6 V out on the voltage measurement. Please calibrate your iron if you have any issues with the cutoff voltage. This calibration is not required if you have no issues. Note that cutoff messages can also be triggered by using a power supply that is too weak and fails under the load of the iron. To calibrate your iron: Measure the input voltage with a multimeter and note it down. Connect the input to your iron. Enter the settings menu Under the Advanced submenu Select the calibrate voltage option Use the front and back buttons to adjust the displayed voltage to minimize the error to your original measurement Press both buttons at the same time to Save and Exit to the menu Calibrate Tip CJC This performs a Tip Cold Junction Calibration (CJC) ( see Temperature for details ). This is normally not needed unless you have an issue with tip temperature or your tips are wearing out prematurely. Changing tip lengths does not necessarily mean a calibration is needed. Check first that your tips are not defective, and measured resistance is close to specifications (Pinecil/TS100 short tips 6.2 \u03a9, long tips 8 \u03a9, TS80(P) ~4.5 \u03a9). What this is for: some tips have an offset on their readings which causes issues, i.e., the actual temperature of the tip is much higher than displayed. To calibrate this out, perform the following steps. Caution: if the method below is not followed, the iron could be worse than before calibration. If you need to repeat the method, first unplug and let the handle/PCB cool down to room temperature. Connect power to your device. Go to Advanced Settings using ( -/B ) and press ( +/A ) to select it. Use ( -/B ) to scroll to Calibrate CJC at next boot and confirm with ( +/A ). Accept the 'warning text' with ( +/A ). Exit the settings menu as usual by pressing and holding ( -/B ). Unplug you device. Critical: Make sure a tip is attached & wait until the tip & handle are at room temperature. (Wait a reasonable amount of time after having used the device.) Power the device and ideally keep it out of your hands (You know it might get warm.). The display shows .... for a short time while the device measures and compares the tip and handle voltages. As a result the new Offset value is displayed. This value can later be viewed in the Debug menu . Calibration is done and the device proceeds booting. Note: offsets are dependant on your tip, temperature sensor, and the MCU. It's the culmination of tolerances at rest. Typical values are 700-1000 range. This is only designed to be used at boot while cold (ambient room temperature), as temperatures drift apart as soon as power is connected. Doing this reading repeatedly could result in wide varience of the offset number and/or incorrect calibration. Boost mode This allows you to change the front button ( +/A ) to become a boost button when you hold it for > 2 seconds. A boost button changes the soldering temperature for short periods. For example, when soldering a big joint and you need a much higher temperature, hold the ( +/A ) button down and it will temporarily increase the temperature to your 'boost' setting. When you release the button, the temperature will gradually go back to the normal set temperature.

This means that the electronics in the handle can only turn the heating element on and off. This means that the power provided in the tip is 100% controlled by the supply voltage used (higher voltage PSU = higher performance). Irons at their simplest are just a resistor (\u03a9) connected to your power source via a switch. When the switch is on, the power in the resistor is: $P(watts) = V(volts) \\times\\ I(current=amps)$ Current through the resistor is: $I(amps) = V(volts) \u00f7 \u03a9 (resistance)$ Combining these gives some common equations for Power $P(watts) = V(volts) * I(amps)$ or $P = V^2 \u00f7 \u03a9$ The resistance of the tip is a fixed constant in ohms (\u03a9): - 6.2 \u03a9 Pine64 short tip - 8.0 \u03a9 TS100/Pinecil long tip - 4.5 \u03a9 TS80(P) This means the power delivered to the soldering tip is proportional to the voltage squared. Therefore the Pinecil and TS100 perform poorly when run off 12V power supplies and may issue a Thermal Runaway message (weak power supply). Use an Ohm calculator to quickly derive watts.

This is constructed for free by using a different type of metal to join one of the rings to the heating coil. This effectively creates a free temperature sensor for very low cost and construction difficulty. The downsides of this are twofold; one, it is made using non-optimal metals and has a non-constant temperature response; and two, as this uses the same connections as the heating current, you can't measure the temperature while you are heating the tip. How a thermocouple works (brief) Thermocouples use a junction of two dissimilar metals to create a very small amount of power (microvolts). This can then be measured and used with a known transfer function to derive the temperature of the junction. This has some fairly large limitations, but it also has the benefit of being extremely cheap. Conventionally a thermocouple is created using two dissimilar metals that join, and then the other ends of these metals are terminated to copper contacts. These copper contacts are also part of the construction of the thermocouple and are referred to as the cold junction. As there are these extra two joins between the thermocouple wires and the copper; these also have properties of their own in their reactions with temperature. If the cold junction is held at 0 degrees Celsius, then their effect is considered to be null, and so they can be ignored. However, in the real world the joins to copper are often at room temperature, and as such the measured voltage from the thermocouple must be compensated to remove the influence of these joints. This process is often called cold junction compensation. Every time in the circuit there is a join between two different metals, then a small thermocouple is created, this means that every soldered connection is also one. How these irons implement the temperature reading If you analyse one of the open circuit schematics (Pinecil, TS100, TS80) they all use the same approximate formula. This consists of an op-amp that is connected directly across the heating connections to the tip, and a separate handle temperature sensor. When the iron is not heating the tip, the microcontroller uses the ADC to read the output from the op-amp. This produces a voltage that should be linear to the temperature of (tip-handle). This value is then offset compensated (to remove ADC+op-amp offsets), and then converted into a temperature delta in \u00b0C/K. This temperature delta can then be added to the handle temperature to derive the tip temperature in degrees Celsius. Depending on the construction of the tip, the lookup values used for converting the tip reading in \u00b5V into \u00b0C/K varies. It is worth noting, however, that TS100 and Pinecil tips are approximately the same as the Hakko T12 tips. (In @Ralim's testing, to within measurement error). This makes sense as the T12 tips are an excellent and cheap design for Miniware to mimic in making the TS100 in the first place. Implications of this Reading accuracy vs Heating performance tradeoff Because the tip can only be measured when the unit is not heating, the more often the tip is measured (for finer temperature control) the less time the unit can spend heating up the tip. This means that for fast heat up and fine temperature control the firmware now implements two speeds to the controller loop. During heating up the system runs fewer temperature measurements and instead allows the tip to spend more time burning power. Once the unit is up to temperature, the rate of taking temperature readings is doubled to allow for faster reaction times. Tip heat up lag time As the temperature sensor is a part of the heater coil inside of the tip (or very close by, not entirely certain); the temperature reading is of the inside of the tip, rather than the outside. The outside temperature is the most critical for the user as this is where the solder is actually melting and performing work. The PID controller in the firmware is tuned to be slightly underdamped and thus more \"jumpy\" than some people would expect. This is based on the theory that if the inside of the tip is seeing the temperature drop; the outside temperature has dropped more and so we should overcompensate until they equalise. This is why sometimes the temperature may flick around a little during use but the tip temperature itself is quite stable. The thermal mass of the tip smooths these small amounts out nicely for the user. Though seeing larger jumps on some tips than others may indicate that the tip does not have optimal internal thermal bonding between the heater coil and the tip itself. The firmware uses the theory that these irons are aimed more to the power users territory than most, so it tries to not hide the actual temperature. Some soldering iron controllers hide the actual measurement once you are within a certain tolerance of this. For example, on a digital Weller unit that Ralim has, if set to 350 \u00b0C, it will regulate to within around +/- 3\u00b0C but not indicate you are outside of the margin of error until you exceed +/- 5\u00b0C. This gives the illusion that it's holding the temperature perfectly when in actuality it's moving around as well. Given enough time (3-5 seconds) with no external cooling, the inside and outside temperatures of the tip will be equal. When testing the tip temperature accuracy try to allow time for the system to stabilise. Complexity of measurement The firmware in these irons does a best-effort of calculating an accurate temperature. As always there is a tradeoff between perfect accuracy and firmware complexity and setup. These irons are built down to a cost; expecting accuracy greater than 1% is not really an option as the voltage reference is only 1% accurate at best. So all measurements are affected by its accuracy. The low-cost chips used in the irons do not come calibrated from the factory so we do not have an internal calibration we can use to try and measure this inaccuracy. The firmware only accounts for cold junction compensation and then treats the remaining error as being a constant offset. While the error is small, it is actually composed of both a constant offset as well as an offset that is linear to the handle temperature. This offset that is linear to handle temperature is as of current not modelled into the firmware and is assumed to be constant. This is generally close enough as once the unit is in use, the handle temperature is usually within 10 \u00b0C as the components inside warm-up from use. This means that this error is \"relatively\" constant once the unit is being used. However, this can cause odd behaviour when the tip temperature ~= room temperature. It can cause some jumping and movement in the readings when attempting to control the tip to sub 100 \u00b0C. This is a known tradeoff that is made as the irons intended use case means that it will spend most of its time above 150 \u00b0C, at which point these errors are no longer the dominant error sources in the system.","title":"Temperature"},{"location":"Temperature/#tip-temperature-measurement","text":"The soldering irons use a modified N-type thermocouple in the tip to measure the tip temperature. This is constructed for free by using a different type of metal to join one of the rings to the heating coil. This effectively creates a free temperature sensor for very low cost and construction difficulty. The downsides of this are twofold; one, it is made using non-optimal metals and has a non-constant temperature response; and two, as this uses the same connections as the heating current, you can't measure the temperature while you are heating the tip.","title":"Tip temperature measurement"},{"location":"Temperature/#how-a-thermocouple-works-brief","text":"Thermocouples use a junction of two dissimilar metals to create a very small amount of power (microvolts). This can then be measured and used with a known transfer function to derive the temperature of the junction. This has some fairly large limitations, but it also has the benefit of being extremely cheap. Conventionally a thermocouple is created using two dissimilar metals that join, and then the other ends of these metals are terminated to copper contacts. These copper contacts are also part of the construction of the thermocouple and are referred to as the cold junction. As there are these extra two joins between the thermocouple wires and the copper; these also have properties of their own in their reactions with temperature. If the cold junction is held at 0 degrees Celsius, then their effect is considered to be null, and so they can be ignored. However, in the real world the joins to copper are often at room temperature, and as such the measured voltage from the thermocouple must be compensated to remove the influence of these joints. This process is often called cold junction compensation. Every time in the circuit there is a join between two different metals, then a small thermocouple is created, this means that every soldered connection is also one.","title":"How a thermocouple works (brief)"},{"location":"Temperature/#how-these-irons-implement-the-temperature-reading","text":"If you analyse one of the open circuit schematics (Pinecil, TS100, TS80) they all use the same approximate formula. This consists of an op-amp that is connected directly across the heating connections to the tip, and a separate handle temperature sensor. When the iron is not heating the tip, the microcontroller uses the ADC to read the output from the op-amp. This produces a voltage that should be linear to the temperature of (tip-handle). This value is then offset compensated (to remove ADC+op-amp offsets), and then converted into a temperature delta in \u00b0C/K. This temperature delta can then be added to the handle temperature to derive the tip temperature in degrees Celsius. Depending on the construction of the tip, the lookup values used for converting the tip reading in \u00b5V into \u00b0C/K varies. It is worth noting, however, that TS100 and Pinecil tips are approximately the same as the Hakko T12 tips. (In @Ralim's testing, to within measurement error). This makes sense as the T12 tips are an excellent and cheap design for Miniware to mimic in making the TS100 in the first place.","title":"How these irons implement the temperature reading"},{"location":"Temperature/#implications-of-this","text":"","title":"Implications of this"},{"location":"Temperature/#reading-accuracy-vs-heating-performance-tradeoff","text":"Because the tip can only be measured when the unit is not heating, the more often the tip is measured (for finer temperature control) the less time the unit can spend heating up the tip. This means that for fast heat up and fine temperature control the firmware now implements two speeds to the controller loop. During heating up the system runs fewer temperature measurements and instead allows the tip to spend more time burning power. Once the unit is up to temperature, the rate of taking temperature readings is doubled to allow for faster reaction times.","title":"Reading accuracy vs Heating performance tradeoff"},{"location":"Temperature/#tip-heat-up-lag-time","text":"As the temperature sensor is a part of the heater coil inside of the tip (or very close by, not entirely certain); the temperature reading is of the inside of the tip, rather than the outside. The outside temperature is the most critical for the user as this is where the solder is actually melting and performing work. The PID controller in the firmware is tuned to be slightly underdamped and thus more \"jumpy\" than some people would expect. This is based on the theory that if the inside of the tip is seeing the temperature drop; the outside temperature has dropped more and so we should overcompensate until they equalise. This is why sometimes the temperature may flick around a little during use but the tip temperature itself is quite stable. The thermal mass of the tip smooths these small amounts out nicely for the user. Though seeing larger jumps on some tips than others may indicate that the tip does not have optimal internal thermal bonding between the heater coil and the tip itself. The firmware uses the theory that these irons are aimed more to the power users territory than most, so it tries to not hide the actual temperature. Some soldering iron controllers hide the actual measurement once you are within a certain tolerance of this. For example, on a digital Weller unit that Ralim has, if set to 350 \u00b0C, it will regulate to within around +/- 3\u00b0C but not indicate you are outside of the margin of error until you exceed +/- 5\u00b0C. This gives the illusion that it's holding the temperature perfectly when in actuality it's moving around as well. Given enough time (3-5 seconds) with no external cooling, the inside and outside temperatures of the tip will be equal. When testing the tip temperature accuracy try to allow time for the system to stabilise.","title":"Tip heat up lag time"},{"location":"Temperature/#complexity-of-measurement","text":"The firmware in these irons does a best-effort of calculating an accurate temperature. As always there is a tradeoff between perfect accuracy and firmware complexity and setup. These irons are built down to a cost; expecting accuracy greater than 1% is not really an option as the voltage reference is only 1% accurate at best. So all measurements are affected by its accuracy. The low-cost chips used in the irons do not come calibrated from the factory so we do not have an internal calibration we can use to try and measure this inaccuracy. The firmware only accounts for cold junction compensation and then treats the remaining error as being a constant offset. While the error is small, it is actually composed of both a constant offset as well as an offset that is linear to the handle temperature. This offset that is linear to handle temperature is as of current not modelled into the firmware and is assumed to be constant. This is generally close enough as once the unit is in use, the handle temperature is usually within 10 \u00b0C as the components inside warm-up from use. This means that this error is \"relatively\" constant once the unit is being used. However, this can cause odd behaviour when the tip temperature ~= room temperature. It can cause some jumping and movement in the readings when attempting to control the tip to sub 100 \u00b0C.

High tip temp reading when the tip is cool If you are finding the tip is reading high; the first fields to check in the Debug menu are RTip and CHan . RTip is the raw tip reading in \u03bcV; at cool this should be around 700-1000 for larger tips and ~1500 for smaller tips (TS80's) CHan is the temperature of the temperature sensor on the PCB in degrees Celsius * 10. So 29 \u00b0C ambient should read as 290 RTip is out of spec RTip will over-read on bad contacts or no tip inserted. If RTip is overreading, you may have one of the following: Partially stuck on main MOSFET Slow reacting main MOSFET driver transistor Damaged Op-Amp Poor soldering on the Op-Amp circuitry No tip inserted or tip that is not connecting correctly If RTip is under-reading you most likely have issues with the Op-Amp or the tip. The signal should be pulled high by hardware (reading hot), so this often means the MCU is not reading the signal correctly. Check MCU soldering. CHan is out of spec CHan reading comes directly from the cold junction compensation temperature sensor. This is usually a TMP36 (Pinecil V1), or an NTC thermistor (MHP30, TS80P, Pinecil V2). If CHan is reading low: Check the connection from the MCU to the handle temperature sensor. Check the power pin connection on the TMP36 Check pullup resistor on the NTC thermistor Check no bridged pins or weak shorts on the signal to nearby pins on MCU or temperature sensor Reflow/resolder the aforementioned components If CHan is reading higher Check ground connections on the sensors Check no bridged pins or weak shorts on the signal to nearby pins on MCU or temperature sensor Reflow/resolder the aforementioned components No display OR dots on the display If when you power up your iron you get no display, the first test is to (carefully) attempt to heat the tip.

These are released early to allow for translation checking and for wonderful people to help spot bugs and regressions. Finally, there are the \"mainline\" builds, which are built from the main git branch. These are built on every change and can be found on the Actions tab (see below). Main release Main releases are made to the releases page . Download the zip file that matches your model of soldering iron and extract it. Select the appropriate file type for your unit, in general Miniware devices need .hex and Pinecil needs .dfu . Flash according to details below Bleeding edge / latest For the latest code, you will need to download the zip file from the artifacts page on the build for what you want. Head to the Actions page and then select the run for the appropriate branch you would like. In general you probably want master . Once you click on a run, scroll down to the \"Artifacts\" section and then click on your model to download a zip file. Then this works the same as a production release (use the correct file). MHP30 This is completely safe, but if it goes wrong just put the .hex file from the official website ( MHP30 onto the unit and you're back to the old firmware. Downloads for the .hex files to flash are available on the releases page. The file you want is called MHP30.zip. Inside the zip file (make sure to extract the file before flashing with it) will be a file called MHP30_{Language-Code}.hex . Officially the bootloader on the devices only works under Windows (use the built-in File Explorer, as alternative file managers or copy handlers like Teracopy will fail). However, users have reported that it does work under Mac, and can be made to work under Linux sometimes . Details over on the wiki page . Hold the button closest to the tip (MHP30 the left button on the back), and plug in the USB to the computer. The unit will appear as a USB drive. (Screen will say DFU on it.) Drag the .hex file onto the USB drive. The unit will disconnect and reconnect. The filename will have changed to end in .RDY or .ERR If it ends with .RDY you're done! Otherwise, something went wrong. If it didn't work the first time, try copying the file again without disconnecting the device, often it will work on the second shot. Disconnect the USB and power up the device. You're good to go. For the more adventurous out there, you can also load this firmware onto the device using an SWD programmer, for easier installation follow the guide at the end of this document. On the USB-C port, USB_D+ is shorted to SWDIO and USB_D- is shorted to SWCLK so debugging works without disassembly (attach while staying in the bootloader). Installing IronOS-dfu is recommended as it allows reliable flashing of binary files with dfu-util .

Finally, there are the \"mainline\" builds, which are built from the main git branch. These are built on every change and can be found on the Actions tab (see below). Main release Main releases are made to the releases page . Download the zip file that matches your model of soldering iron and extract it. Select the appropriate file type for your unit, in general Miniware devices need .hex and Pinecil needs .dfu . Flash according to details below Bleeding edge / latest For the latest code, you will need to download the zip file from the artifacts page on the build for what you want. Head to the Actions page and then select the run for the appropriate branch you would like. In general you probably want master . Once you click on a run, scroll down to the \"Artifacts\" section and then click on your model to download a zip file. Then this works the same as a production release (use the correct file). Pinecil V1 The MCU used in Pinecil supports usb-dfu. Reference Pinecil Wiki . Recommended Updater: the Pine64 Updater , is an easy-to-use GUI app. It is fast and works in several types of OS, i.e. Windows/Mac. It will automatically fetch the newest stable version of IronOS from GitHub. Troubleshooting: if you have issues using the Pine64 Updater or your install fails, please go to troubleshooting tips below. Community chat: if troubleshooting doesn't work, then join the Pine64 > Pinecil channel. There are knowledgeable members in Discord/Telegram/Matrix. Discord has a bridge bot connection to Telegram and Matrix so that all pine volunteers/members can see advice for Pinecil and related items or just get tips on which Power supply to purchase. One advantage of Pinecil is that you cannot permanently damage it doing a firmware update (because DFU is in ROM); an update could render Pinecil temporarily inoperable if you flash an invalid firmware. But no worries, simply re-flashing with a working firmware copy will fix everything. USB-C cable is required to do an update. Generally, all USB controllers work, but some hubs have issues, so it is preferred to avoid USB hubs for updates. Alternate Update Methods: if your OS is not currently supported by the Updater or it does not meet your needs, i.e., you want to install a beta version, the below manual methods may be used. Linux and Mac Steps \u26d4 Do not use the DC barrel jack while updating firmware or you may destroy your PC. \u26d4 Highly recommend updating dfu-util to the newest version before starting. Download and extract the firmware package from GitHub IronOS Releases . Enter DFU mode: press and hold ( - ) button at the back of the iron before you connect the USB-C cable. Connect USB to PC, and USB-C to back of Pinecil, keep holding ( - ) button down. Once the USB cable is connected at two ends, wait ~10 seconds more, then release the ( - ) button. The screen will stay black/off to indicate the Pinecil is in DFU mode. This is normal. Using dfu-util you can flash the firmware using a command line like this: dfu-util -D Pinecil_EN.dfu Choose the file name from the folder with the appropriate 2-letter country code for your chosen language (i.e., EN = English). Troubleshooting: If you get a message stating that More than one DFU capable USB device found! when running the above command you probably have an old version of dfu-util installed. Might be worth updating. You can still install on the old version, but you will have to specify which DFU interface to flash to. Running the command dfu-util -l will show you if there are several DFU devices detected. Example: Found DFU: [28e9:0189] ver=0100, devnum=48, cfg=1, intf=0, path=\"1-1\", alt=1, name=\"@Option Bytes /0x1FFFF800/01*016Be\", serial=\"??\" Found DFU: [28e9:0189] ver=0100, devnum=48, cfg=1, intf=0, path=\"1-1\", alt=0, name=\"@Internal Flash /0x08000000/128*001Kg\", serial=\"??\" In this example we see that more than one part of the Pinecil is detected as a DFU interface and we need to specify which one we want to flash to. We want the Internal Flash so in this case we can use alt=0 to identify which interface to target. The command would then look like this: dfu-util -D Pinecil_EN.dfu -a 0 Note: if you use an older release of dfu-util and do not see alt=0, name=\"@Internal Flash /0x08000000/128*001Kg\" when running dfu-util -l you likely will not be able to update without first updating 'dfu-util'. If your update is crashing part-way into the update, there is sometimes an issue with older/fussy USB controllers (they can show up/disappear/then show up again) Try a direct connection to the USB port, do not use a USB hub, and use shorter cable. If possible, pick a port connected to the main board. Switch to a different PC/Laptop and use different ports. USB-C ports are recommended but some have also reported having a fussy C port. Hold down the (-) button for the entire firmware update, do not release until near the end. DC Low message: a pc/laptop cannot fully power Pinecil, it generally can only get 5 V (non-PD) to communicate for firmware updates and Pinecil will report 'DC Low'. This is normal. If dfu-util aborts with an error like dfu-util: Cannot open DFU device 28e9:0189 found on devnum 42 (LIBUSB_ERROR_IO) and dmesg reports USB errors like these kernel: usb 1-1: reset full-speed USB device number 42 using xhci_hcd kernel: usb 1-1: device descriptor read/64, error -71 kernel: usb 1-1: device descriptor read/64, error -71 kernel: usb 1-1: reset full-speed USB device number 42 using xhci_hcd kernel: usb 1-1: device descriptor read/64, error -71 kernel: usb 1-1: device descriptor read/64, error -71 kernel: usb 1-1: reset full-speed USB device number 42 using xhci_hcd kernel: usb 1-1: Device not responding to setup address. kernel: usb 1-1: Device not responding to setup address. kernel: usb 1-1: device not accepting address 42, error -71 then try to disable USB autosuspend.

Highly recommend updating dfu-util to the newest version. Download and extract the firmware package from GitHub IronOS Releases . Enter DFU mode: press and hold (-) button at the back of the iron (do not release). Connect USB to PC, and USB-C to the back of Pinecil, keep holding (-) button down. Screen will stay black/off to indicate the Pinecil is in DFU mode. This is normal. After the USB cable is connected at both ends, wait ~10 seconds more, then release the (-) button. Open PowerShell or Command window. Change to the directory of the unzipped firmware files Using dfu-util, flash the firmware using a command like this: dfu-util -D Pinecil_EN.dfu If you have errors, see Troubleshooting above. Option 2: use the GUI tool from chip vendor Steps \u26d4 Do not use the DC barrel jack while updating firmware or you may destroy your PC. \u26d4 If you are uncomfortable with the command line, then this chip vendor supplied GUI tool/drivers is an option. Download and extract the firmware package from GitHub IronOS Releases . Download both the GD32 MCU DFU TOOL and the GD32 Dfu Drivers . GD32 DFU Tool here .

Check properties of both downloads, tick Unblock if needed, then Unzip Install the drivers and the GD32 DFU tool (ignore prompts to update the tool). Enter DFU mode: press and hold ( - ) button at the back of Pinecil (do not release). Connect Pinecil to a PC via USB cable (do not release the ( - ) yet). Screen will stay black/off to indicate the Pinecil is in DFU mode. This is normal. You may hear a beep from Windows as it connects to Pinecil in DFU mode. If you see windows notification that it does not recognize USB device , then you didn't connect, repeat step 3-8. Open the GD32 DFU Tool (ignore prompts to update tool). At the top of the DFU tool, you should see GD DFU DEVICE 1 appear if you successfully connected Pinecil. If DFU Device box at top is blank, then Pinecil is not connected in DFU mode, repeat steps 3-11. If it has been more than 10 seconds since you connected the USB cable, Release the ( - ) button.

TS100 This is completely safe, but if it goes wrong just put the .hex file from the official website ( TS100 onto the unit and you're back to the old firmware. Downloads for the .hex files to flash are available on the releases page. The file you want is called TS100.zip. Inside the zip file (make sure to extract the file before flashing with it) will be a file called TS100_{Language-Code}.hex . Officially the bootloader on the devices only works under Windows (use the built-in File Explorer, as alternative file managers or copy handlers like Teracopy will fail). However, users have reported that it does work under Mac, and can be made to work under Linux sometimes . Details over on the wiki page . Hold the button closest to the tip (MHP30 the left button on the back), and plug in the USB to the computer. The unit will appear as a USB drive. (Screen will say DFU on it.) Drag the .hex file onto the USB drive. The unit will disconnect and reconnect. The filename will have changed to end in .RDY or .ERR If it ends with .RDY you're done! Otherwise, something went wrong. If it didn't work the first time, try copying the file again without disconnecting the device, often it will work on the second shot. Disconnect the USB and power up the device. You're good to go. For the more adventurous out there, you can also load this firmware onto the device using an SWD programmer, for easier installation follow the guide at the end of this document. On the bottom of the MCU riser PCB, there are 4 pads for programming. On v2.51A PCB revision USB_D+ is shorted to SWDIO and USB_D- is shorted to SWCLK so debugging works without disassembly (attach while staying in the bootloader). Installing IronOS-dfu is recommended as it allows reliable flashing of binary files with dfu-util . On some newer TS100 units, the SWD pins are wired up to the USB pins, on older ones they are not sadly. Mac sgr1ff1n (Shane) commented in issue 11 that upgrading worked on their Mac as per normal: I just wanted to say that I was able to update the firmware on my ts100 from the stock version to 1.08 found in this repository using my Mac. I simply followed the same steps however through Finder. I have a MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2012) running Sierra 10.12.4 (16E195). Linux While in the past there were reports of unreliable upgrades, the consensus in issue 11 is that things work mostly as expected in Linux. @awigen has contributed a script flash_ts100_linux.sh that works on Ubuntu 16.04 as well as other distros. If you want to do it manually (or if the script does not work for some reason) the general procedure is the same as for Windows, the differences are in the way to mount the unit and copy the firmware. Remember that after flashing, the firmware filename will have changed to end in .RDY or .ERR or .NOT and only .RDY means the flashing was successful! The unit has to be mounted as msdos type (thanks @balrog-kun for having spotted it). You may disable automount, but unmounting the automounted drive and remounting as msdos works fine. You do not need to turn off automounting, but you do need to unmount the device with umount . It is recommended to use an all-caps filename for the firmware, even if successful flashing were done with lower case names. Avoid USB hubs, plug directly in your computer. If it fails, try again several times without unplugging. Just let it remount. Example, to be run as root, once the unit has been plugged in DFU mode and auto-mounted: FW=ts100.hex unset NAME eval $(lsblk -P -p -d --output NAME,MODEL|grep \"DFU[ _]Disk\") [ -z ${NAME+x} ] && exit 1 # Could not find DFU device umount \"$NAME\" mkdir /tmp/mntdfu mount -t msdos \"$NAME\" /tmp/mntdfu cp \"$FW\" \"/tmp/mntdfu/$(basename $FW|tr a-z A-Z)\" sync umount /tmp/mntdfu rmdir /tmp/mntdfu Device will reboot and automount will rerun if not disabled. Check the extension of your firmware, it should be .RDY now. FAQ The file is showing up with the extension .ERR This can occur during the programming process if any of the checks in the bootloader fail. This is often triggered by anti-virus software or using a non-Windows host OS. First, try just copying the file a second time. Attach the iron in DFU mode. Copy the .hex file to the device. The device disconnects and connects with the .ERR file. Copy the same .hex file again \u26d4 DO NOT TRY AND DELETE THE OLD ONE \u26d4 . The device will disconnect and reconnect again. The device should now have the .RDY file. You're done. If this fails and you are on Mac or Linux reading the wiki page about programming can help. There is also a very long issue thread going through all of the different attempts around this too. If you are on Windows, it's often best to try another computer (friends, work, partners etc.). Device randomly disconnects or does not show up in DFU mode Check if the USB cable you are using has the data pins; test it on another device.
