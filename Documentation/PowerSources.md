# Power sources

Supported by IronOS hardware may use different power sources (chargers/powerbanks/battery packs) with different standards & protocols (QC/PD/etc). This document contains information collected by the community with tested power sources.

This is not ads but first hands-on experience results from real users since some chargers/powerbanks regardless labels on the box may not fully support what's declared!


## QC(3)


### Compatible Devices (QuickCharge for TS80/P)

The following table is the list of compatible device and remarks when powering up the TS80 through it for both stock firmware from MiniDso and IronOS. The list of devices below are primarily taken from [#349](https://github.com/Ralim/ts100/issues/349#issuecomment-449559806)

\* Need further tests on newer firmware

\*\* Most Power Banks shut down if current draw drops below 50mA, assuming that charging is complete and avoiding overcharging. Custom firmware is designed to avoid this until it enters Zzzz mode.


### DIY QC3.0

You may also build your own QC3.0 power source that requires this little [thing](https://www.tindie.com/products/soubitos/qualcomm-qc2-3-diy-8-32vin-36-12vout-3a-max/) and have at least 3S lithium packs or any input voltage from 8 to 32V.

You can also go for an [alternate module](https://www.banggood.com/DC-Buck-Module-12V24V-to-QC3_0-Single-USB-Mobile-Charging-Board-p-1310585.html) which has at least one good review of it.

**DISCLAIMER:** _**We do not hold any responsibility for accidents that happen when building your own QC3.0 power source!!!**_


## PD

The following additional table is the list of devices compatible with hardware which requires Power Delivery support (>= 30W). Devices from the list have been successfully tested & used with TS80P in PD mode. Please, keep in mind that:

- PD can be provided only through usb-c <-> usb-c cable;
- not only a charger but a cable itself should be capable to carry higher wattages.


### Compatible Devices (PowerDelivery for TS80P)

| Device Name | IronOS FW |
|-------------|:---------:|
| Traver Charger QC09 (45W max)\* | OK |
| Xiaomi AD65GEU Mi 65W Fast Charger with GaN Tech (AD65GEU, 65W max) | OK |

\* Comes as an _option_ for extra price in the package with TS80P from [official store](https://aliexpress.com/item/4000764937427.html) or from [NovelLife store separately](https://aliexpress.com/item/4001316262433.html) on AliExpress.

Please, DO NOT BUY cheap "fast chargers with QC/PD support" for a few dollars online (i.e., less than ~10$): if you check reviews, then you see that they are phonies - even if you get lucky, you probably get 5V/1A max from them.
