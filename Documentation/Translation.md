# Translation

At the present time the main way of performing translations is to open a PR to this repository.
All translations are stored as `json` files in the repository. Currently there is ongoing work to look into a more user friendly method of editing translations than these but for now these are reliable.

You can create a pull request with the new / updated json configuration file, and this will include this language into the new builds for the firmware.

For testing you can build locally and test of course; but if you dont want to figure out the build environment; you can just open a PR and github will build the firmware for you using the _actions_ feature.

This means that once you have a github account you can perform all of your edits inside Github should this be desired.

Translations are _NOT_ accepted via issues/discussions or email.
