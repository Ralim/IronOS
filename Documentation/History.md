# Version Changes


# V2.21

### Features & changes

- Bluetooth Low Energy support for PinecilV2
- Large cleanup of translation files; and refactor of how we handle fonts for translations
- Fixes for I2C corruption on PinecilV2
- Option for using adjustable profiles on USB-PD or not
- Cleanups and improvements to the generated [documents website](https://ralim.github.io/IronOS)

### PinecilV2 notes

For Pinecil V2 users blisp is currently my recommended CLI tool for updating the device. It is built for all main OS's automatically. This does not apply to V1 devices. If your iron came with a blue grip, its a V1 and update the same as always. If your device came with a green silicone grip its a V2 device.

Alternatively you can use Spagett1's PineFlash tool that should provide a GUI interface for PinecilV1 & PinecilV2.

For a small number of V2 Pinecil devices there appears to be an interference issue between the Bluetooth Low Energy and some devices; more information here. If this occurs to you, please let us know in the issue and rollback to 2.20 for now.


# V2.20

- First "full" release for PinecilV2
- Loots of documentation updates
- Documentation is [now nicely readable as a site](https://ralim.github.io/IronOS/GettingStarted)
- A fair collection of bugfixes for PinecilV2
- Cold Junction Calibration was reworked and now occurs _at next boot_ to make it easier to perform when the device is cold


# V2.19

- Bug-fix Infinite Boot Logo
- Shutdown settings for MHP30
- Accelerometer sensitivity for MHP30
- Allow showing unique device ID
- Bug-fix chance of a power pulse at device boot
- Updated translations
- Improved documents, added features table


# V2.18

- Support for animated bootup logo's
- Bootup logo's moved to their own IronOS-Meta repo
- New Vietnamese translation (limited due to screen size)
- Fixes for SC7A20 in TS80(P)
- Updated translations
- Better Instructions/documents


# V2.17

### Features & changes

- Indicate status of VBus for modding Pinecil (debug menu)
- Better hall effect sensor sensitivity adjustment (larger range with more steps)
- Temperature increment will "round" to nearest multiple of increase amount
- Build setup migrated to Alpine (You can now build in docker easily, and on PinePhone/PinePhonePro)
- -> Removed proprietary compiler for Pinecil RISCV now all uses normal gcc
- -> Removed using the arm specific build of gcc for the one that alpine ships (Miniware devices)
- Logo generator python script creates `.dfu` files for ease of use with Pinecil
- Upgrades to translations
- Support for new GD32103 based TS100 units turning up on the market
- Raw hall effect reading now shows in the Pinecil debug menu
- Fixed automatic orientation for newer TS80P's with the SC7 accelerometer
- User interface slight changes
- New `metadata.zip` file to allow the Pine Updater to automatically fetch information on releases

### Notes

- VBus mod detection may not play well with all PPS chargers. If your iron reboots when you view this in the debug menu its not a fault. ([#1226](https://github.com/Ralim/IronOS/issues/1226))
- `metadata.zip` is only designed for use by automatic software, ignore it for normal use
- More details on Pinecil VBus mod coming via other channels.
- Hall effect sensor is not fitted to Pinecil's by default, you have to fit this yourself if you want the feature
- Tweaks to the Accelerometer code means the drivers are slightly more fussy. If you run into any issues let us know in the discussion or issues.
- -> Release has been updated to build `e065be3` after one bug with the BMA223 was found.


# V2.16

- Overhaul of the Timer+ADC setup with help from @sandmanRO
- Overhaul of the PID with help from @sandmanRO
- Settings _should_ now upgrade in place to future versions, with resets only happening to new/changed settings
- Shows error if tip runaway (failed temperature sensor) is detected
- USB-PD now has a timeout, to allow forcing QC3 negotiation to start faster
- QC3 Voltages are now adjustable to user desired setpoint
- Added a small tolerance to allow "overvoltage" on QC3 above unit specifications.
    - Please note: Doing this is entirely at your own risk!
- New Advanced view that is much nicer to use and a very good daily driver option from @Mel-kior
- OLED brightness and contrast thanks to @alvinhochun
- Scrollbar is fixed so it doesnt jump around when menus are shown/hidden
- Moved to `.dfu` files from `.bin` to make flashing commands easier
- Every language had translation updates I believe
- Romanian language added


# V2.15

### Features & changes

- MHP30 support
- Multi-lingual firmware combinations now exist for Pinecil
- More fine grained voltage controlled options
- USB-PD improvements (version one and two)
- More configuration options for power pulse
- All font / character encoding has been very reworked
- More translation updates than one can count 
- More languages ðŸ˜± 

### MHP30 support

The MHP30 is a small reflow station from Miniware.
Thanks to a massive amount of help from @g3gg0 this firmware brings the beginnings of support for this unit.
Also kudo's to @Vinigas  and @GoJian for helping with testing.
This is not a _final_ version I'm sure, but this is a working, usable version of firmware support.
Programs the same as any one Miniware unit using drag and drop.
**Note: The boot logo scripts will need updates for this unit, so not supported yet.**

The flood doors are now open for feature requests for this unit :)
