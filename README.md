# TS100
Source code for the TS100 Soldering Iron

This repository is my modifications for the source code for the ts100 soldering iron. 
With the aim of removing the need to use usb for configuration and instead supporting an on-device menu system to allow in the field settings changes.

Also plan is to add more features for battery support.
