# IronOS - Open Source Flexible Firmware for Soldering Hardware

_This repository was formerly known as TS100, it's the same great code. Just with more supported devices._

Originally conceived as an alternative firmware for the _TS100_, this firmware has evolved into a complex soldering hardware control firmware.

The firmware implements all of the standard features of a _smart_ soldering hardware, with lots of little extras and tweaks.
I highly recommend reading the installation guide fully when installing on your device. And after install just explore the settings menu.

For soldering hardware that is designed to be powered by _smart_ power sources such as _PD_ or _QC_, the firmware supports settings around the negotiated power and voltage.
For soldering hardware that is designed to be powered by batteries (_TS100_ & _Pinecil_), settings for a cutoff voltage for battery protection are supported.

Currently **31** languages are supported. When downloading the firmware for your soldering hardware, take note of the _language code_ in the file name.

This project is considered feature complete for use on a daily basis, _so please suggest any feature improvements you would like!_

_This firmware does **NOT** support the USB port while running for changing settings (this is done through the onscreen menu only). Custom logos are edited on a computer and flashed in the same manner as firmware._

_Tip Sense_ refers to the device being able to choose between the _"regular"_ _TS100_ or _Hakko T12 style_ tips and _Pine64_'s custom shorter tips which have lower resistance and allow for more power. This is N/A for _TS80(P)_ as there is only one model of tip for them.

_Recommended Purchase_ is only referring to if you are buying a **new** device. Of course all the devices listed are supported and will work excellently for years to come.

The _TS101_ & _S60(P)_ irons and _MHP30_ & _T55_ plates feature a higher resolution OLED than other devices. Work is ongoing to support this fully, for now a cropped view is usable.

\* _PinecilV1_ stopped being manufactured a long time ago now, all models for sale online are generally clones (or old stock). Vendors are trying to sell these for more than _Pine64_ sells the _V2_ for now. Thus the _V1_ is **_no longer recommended_**.

\*\* Please note that _Miniware_ started shipping _TS100_'s using **cloned STM32 chips**. While these do work with _IronOS_, their **DFU bootloader** works terribly, and it is hard to get it to successfully flash larger firmware images like _IronOS_ without timing out. This is the main reason why the _TS100_ is **_no longer recommended_**.

\*\*\* _TS80_ is replaced by _TS80P_. Production ramped down a long time ago and it's just existing stock clearing the system. It's marked not recommended being optimistic that people might pause and buy the far superior _TS80P_ instead. This is the main reason why the _TS80_ is **_no longer recommended_**.

    [See the full changelog here](https://ralim.github.io/IronOS/History).

## Basic Control

Supported device is controlled by two buttons which can be pressed in the following ways:
 - short: ~1 second or so;
 - long: more than 1 second;
 - both (press & hold both of them together).

Available buttons are:
 - `+/A` button: near the front closer to the tip (for irons) or on the left side of the device (for plates);
 - `-/B` button: near the back far from the tip (for irons) or on the right side of the device (for plates).

After powering on the device for the first time with _IronOS_ installed and having the tip/plate plugged in, on the main menu in _standby mode_ the unit shows a pair of prompts for the two most common operations:
- pressing the `+/A` button enters the _soldering mode_;
- pressing the `-/B` button enters the _settings menu_;
- in _soldering mode_:
  - short press of `+/A` / `-/B` buttons changes the soldering temperature;
  - long press of the `+/A` button enables _boost mode_ (increasing soldering temperature to the adjustable setting as long as the button is pressed);
  - long press of the `-/B` button enters _standby mode_ and stops heating;
- in _standby mode_:
  - long press of the `+/A` button enters _soldering temperature adjust mode_ (the same as the one in the _soldering mode_, but allows to adjust the temperature before heating up);
  - long hold of the `-/B` button enters the [_debug menu_](https://ralim.github.io/IronOS/DebugMenu/);
- in _menu mode_ (to make it short here):
  - `-/B` scrolls & cycles through menus and submenus;
  - `+/A` enters to menu & submenu settings or changes their values if they are activated already.

Additional details are described in the [menu information](https://ralim.github.io/IronOS/Menu/).
