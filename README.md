# Upgrading your ts100 iron
This is completely safe, if it goes wrong just put the .hex file from the official website onto the unit and your back to the old firmware :)

1. Hold the button closest to the tip, and plug in the USB to the computer.
2. The unit will appear as a USB drive.
3. Drag the .hex file onto the USB drive.
4. The unit will disconnect and reconnect.
5. The filename will have changed to end in .RDY or .ERR .
6. If it ends with .RDY your done! Otherwise something went wrong.
7. If it went wrong try on a windows computer, some Mac / Linux machines do not play well with their boot loader.
