# IronOS - Flexible Soldering iron control Firmware

_This repository was formerly known as TS100, it's the same great code. Just with more supported devices._

Originally conceived as an alternative firmware for the TS100, this firmware has evolved into a complex soldering iron control firmware.

The firmware implements all of the standard features of a 'smart' soldering iron, with lots of little extras and tweaks.
I highly recommend reading the installation guide fully when installing on your iron. And after install just explore the settings menu.

For soldering irons that are designed to be powered by 'smart' power sources (PD and QC), the firmware supports settings around the negotiated power and voltage.
For soldering irons that are designed to be powered by batteries (TS100 & Pinecil), settings for a cutoff voltage for battery protection are supported.

Currently **31** languages are supported. When downloading the firmware for your soldering iron, take note of the language code in the file name.

This project is considered feature complete for use as a soldering iron, _so please suggest any feature improvements you would like!_

_This firmware does **NOT** support the USB port while running for changing settings. This is done through the onscreen menu only. Logos are edited on a computer and flashed like firmware._

_Tip Sense_ refers to the device being able to choose between the 'usual' TS100 or Hakko T12 style tips and Pine64's custom shorter tips which have lower resistance and allow for more power. This is N/A for TS80/TS80P as there is only one model of tip for them.

_Recommended Purchase_ is only referring to if you are buying a **new** device. Of course all the devices listed are supported and will work excellently for years to come.

The TS101 and S60 feature a higher resolution OLED than other devices. Work is ongoing to support this fully, for now a cropped view is usable.

\*PinecilV1 stopped being manufactured a long time ago now, all models for sale online are generally clones (or old stock). Vendors are trying to sell these for more than Pine64 sells the V2 for now. Thus the V1 is **_no longer recommended_**.

\**Please note that Miniware started shipping TS100's using cloned STM32 Chips. While these do work with IronOS, their DFU bootloader works terribly, and it is hard to get it to successfully flash larger firmware images like IronOS without timing out. This is the main reason why the TS100 is **_no longer recommended_**.

\**\*TS80 is replaced by TS80P. Production ramped down a long time ago and it's just existing stock clearing the system. It's marked not recommended being optimistic that people might pause and buy the far superior TS80P instead. This is the main reason why the TS80 is **_no longer recommended_**.

## Getting Started

To get started with IronOS firmware, please jump to [Getting Started Guide](https://ralim.github.io/IronOS/GettingStarted/).
But the [TL;DR](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/TL%3BDR) is to press the button near the front of the iron to heat up. Use the button near the back of the iron to enter the settings menu.
Long hold the rear button in soldering mode to exit back to the start screen.

## Installation

For notes on installation for your device, please refer to the flashing guide for your device:

- [MHP30](https://ralim.github.io/IronOS/Flashing/MHP30)
- [Pinecil V1](https://ralim.github.io/IronOS/Flashing/Pinecil%20V1/)
- [Pinecil V2](https://ralim.github.io/IronOS/Flashing/Pinecil%20V2/)

- (TS80/TS80P/Pinecil) Power bank operating voltage is displayed
- [Custom boot up logo support](https://ralim.github.io/IronOS/Logo/)[^bootlogo]
- Automatic LCD rotation based on the orientation


[^bootlogo]: **BOOTUP LOGO NOTICE**:
  IronOS supports both a bootup logo _AND_ bootup animations.
  However, _**they are no longer included in this repo**_.
  **Please, [read the docs](https://ralim.github.io/IronOS/Logo/) for more information**.

## Menu System

This new firmware uses a new menu system to allow access to the settings on the device.
When on the main screen and having the tip plugged in, the unit shows a pair of prompts for the two most common operations.

- Pressing the button near the tip enters the _soldering mode_
- Pressing the button near the USB end enters the _settings menu_
- When not in _soldering mode_, holding down the button near the tip will enter _soldering temperature adjust mode_ (This is the same as the one in the _soldering mode_, but allows to adjust the temperature before heating up), in _soldering mode_ however this will activate _boost mode_ as long as you hold down the button.
- Holding down the button near the USB end will show the _[debug menu](https://ralim.github.io/IronOS/DebugMenu/)._ In _soldering mode_ this ends the heating.

Operation details are over in the [Menu information.](https://ralim.github.io/IronOS/Menu/)
