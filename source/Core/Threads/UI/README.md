# UI

The User interface for IronOS is split into two halves in these folders.
The `logic` folder contains the `.cpp` files that implement the logic of each mode, this should handle button events and any logic.
The `drawing` folder contains the `.cpp` files that implement just the screen drawing for each mode. These are further subdivided by the screen _types_.
