/* Each FreeRTOS port has a unique portmacro.h header file.  Originally a
 * pre-processor definition was used to ensure the pre-processor found the correct
 * portmacro.h file for the port being used.  That scheme was deprecated in favour
 * of setting the compiler's include path such that it found the correct
 * portmacro.h file - removing the need for the constant and allowing the
 * portmacro.h file to be located anywhere in relation to the port being used.  The
 * definitions below remain in the code for backward compatibility only.  New
 * projects should not use them. */
