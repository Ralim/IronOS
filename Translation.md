# Translation
If you would like to contribute a translation, use the [Translation Editor](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Ralim/ts100/blob/master/Translation%20Editor/TranslationEditor.html).

[Open a reference language file and optionally a target language file](https://github.com/Ralim/ts100/tree/master/Translation%20Editor).

You can create an issue with your updated json translation, or make your own pull request. If you make a pull request, also run `python3 make_translation.py` to regenerate the source file.
